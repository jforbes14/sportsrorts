Data to use:
First iteration use 2016 boundaries
Second iteration impute 2019 TPP using polling booths

Before modelling:
A few basic plots
- Distribution of TPP
- Scatter plot of grant $ against TPP

Explain RDD:
- Fuzzy RDD
- Use Grant $ or binary choice (grants, no grants) as response
- Pick 6 variables to use as controls, show there is no discontinuity at cut-off of 50% TPP

Modelling:
Fuzzy RDD, interpret coefficient of discontinuity
Can justify causal impact
